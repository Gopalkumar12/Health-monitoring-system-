# IoT-Based Health Monitoring System

This project is an IoT-based health monitoring system using an Arduino Nano, MAX30100 sensor, and OLED display. It monitors vital signs like heart rate and SpO2 levels and displays them in real-time.

## Components Used

- Arduino Nano (or Mini)
- MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor
- OLED Display (0.96", I2C)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- USB cable

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of heart rate and SpO2
- OLED display for on-device reading
- Lightweight and portable design
- Future-ready for IoT/cloud integration

## Circuit Diagram

## Code

Code is located in the `/code` folder. You can upload the `.ino` file directly using the Arduino IDE.

## Future Improvements

- Add temperature sensor
- Send data to cloud (e.g., ThingSpeak, Firebase)
- Android/iOS app for remote monitoring
- Add alert system (buzzer/SMS)
